**Chameleon** is a Minecraft mod, and a Metamorph add-on, which allows to import static and animated [Blockbench](https://blockbench.net/) models into Metamorph's morph system, which allows using loaded Blockbench models as morphs (i.e. you can morph into animated models), actors, decorations or custom projectiles (through Blockbuster mod). 

This mod works only with Forge for Minecraft **1.12.2**. 

Chameleon **1.1** and up doesn't require [GeckoLib](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib) anymore.  
Chameleon mod below version **1.1** is powered by [GeckoLib](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib) (**3.0.0 or above** but below versiob **3.0.0-beta8**), an amazing animation library for Minecraft mod!

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available Minecraft version. Also install following mods: [McLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mchorses-mclib), and [Metamorph](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/metamorph). Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Chameleon mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Chameleon didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong.

## Bug reports

If you found a bug, or this mod crashed your game, make sure to check this [compatibility table and incompatible mod list](https://github.com/mchorse/mclib/wiki/Compatibility-table-of-McHorse%27s-mods) page. The most frequent issue people encounter is that they didn't install the compatible versions of my mods. Or updated only one mod while using older version of my other mods.

If the versions of the mod are correct, then you can report a bug or a crash to me either on [issue tracker](https://github.com/mchorse/chameleon/issues/), or on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qfxrqUF).
